<h1>Web Design</h1>
<p>Web design is a form of graphic design that focuses on the layout, appearance and functionality of web pages. Web designers use a wide range of techniques to present information to users on the World Wide Web. Web design includes concepts such as usability, user experience, visual design and information architecture. A web designer's role can vary from project-to-project and might include writing HTML code, creating graphics and images, setting up the appropriate hosting environment for the site, testing it with users, and then optimizing its performance.
