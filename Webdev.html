<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>Web development is the process of designing, writing and testing a web page or application. Web developers use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive web applications. Web developers also use other technologies like PHP, Ruby on Rails among others. These technologies are used to create dynamic pages that can be accessed by a wide range of devices. Web developers have to be creative in their approach as they have to make sure that the code they write can be easily read by all people who access their site. They need to keep in mind that there are different types of users who may access their site and that each type may need different types of information from them.</p>
